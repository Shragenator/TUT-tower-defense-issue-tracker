**Welcome to the Issue Tracker for Turnt Up Tower Defense**

Note that this is not a place to leave feedback about the game or make suggestions for features. Our discord is a great place to have those sorts of discussions. 
This issue tracker is for reporting unintended behavior in the webapp and game as a whole.

*Steps for reporting a bug:*

1. Search to see if your issue has already been reported
2. If someone has reported the same issue or a similar issue, feel free to leave aditional details in the comments
3. If the issue you are experiencing has not been covered, open a new issue with information about what behavior occurred during the bug, what behavior you expected to happen, and what steps led to the bug occuring (how to reproduce).
